I was not looking for an internship rather a full time position but with a non-professional degree it was much harder to find someone to lend me a chance. During my search I applied to many firms both near and far hoping that a firm would be interested. About a two weeks sending in an application to my current office I received a response asking for a phone call. After the phone call the principle asked for an in person interview with the office manager.",
                "Experience During Interview": "The first phone conversation lasted roughly twenty-five minutes. The in person interview was just over one hour long with two people. I dressed in business while they dressed in casual; this made me feel a bit over dressed but I am used to this as I usually dress nice. They were looking to just advance the conversation and learn more about my personality.\n\nThere were some reservations on their side being that I had never held a professional position within a firm and the timeline of me working for their office. I was honest with them mentioning some reasons to not hire me in addition to my future goals: 1. go to graduate school, 2. move closer to a major city, 3. and advocate/create healthy and meaningful design.",
                "Lessons Learned": "There are some specific questions that I would ask future employers more in depth and gage their responses more heavily. I believe that I was made to believe that this firm was something that aligns with my values and design advocacy when in reality in differs greatly.",

The interview lasted about 30 to 40 minutes and primarily consisted of conversation about my current and previous experience, and even though i presented my portfolio there was little discussion in regard to it.  I appeared to meet all the expectations even raised a few eyebrows in a positive way.  Overall it was a very positive experience and I was fairly confident I would be hearing back from them.",
                "Lessons Learned": "An experience I learned from this scenario is that no matter how well you do in the interview and present yourself to the company.  Some decisions have to be made with the business in mind.  I might have been qualified for the position in many ways and overall every interviewed might have given the thumbs up, but what it came down to was the salary.  The business could not be as competitive as my current employer at that time and so they could not provide an offer.  With that said, you have to take disappoints like that and move on, because like i said, its just business.",

                "Background Story": "During the Summer of 2015 I was looking for a place to work, while still being able to stay with my parents (free rent/food).  I happened to stumble upon a small local firm that work primarily in Russellville, AR.  I asked if they were hiring, and they seemed very enthusiastic to be able to give someone the opportunity to further their knowledge.  They then requested an interview the next day. ",
                "Experience During Interview": "The initial felling of my first interview was similar to walking into the woods at night and not knowing what was going to happen. But as meet the two people interviewing me, I found them to be very smart an respectable people.  After some general questions about the software I knew and my experience with the field and the schools program, they asked some general questions about how I would be getting to work and of anything they may need to know.  Since the firm was in a small city, the dress code was not as formal as some would think.  I came to the interview wearing a button up, blazer, and khakis, which I could have just done without the blazer. And as the Interview concluded, they offered me a position during the summer, and asked me to start almost immediately. ",
                "Lessons Learned": "It is important to be able to realize that there are many different type of companies out there today.  Where some require a full suit, and some just require you to wear clothes you're comfortable in.  Architecture is a very diverse profession, so it can be useful to clear all expectations of the work environment and really narrow down what youre looking for in a firm,  whether its a professional environment, friendships with your co-workers, or just a sense of belonging.  Its important to be prepared for anything. ",

                "Background Story": "This interview came about from a contact I made at a career fair which our university was hosting. Firms participated from around the state. There was one firm I was focusing my efforts on and I started an email correspondence with him throughout the rest of the semester. Whenever I contacted him about any openings his firm he stated that they were not hiring at the moment. I politely asked if there were any other firms in town hiring and he pointed me in a direction. A week later I received a second email stating that there was going to be an opening and they would like to see me for an interview.",
                "Experience During Interview": "I was sitting at a conference table with 3 principles of the firm and together they interrogated me. They were very friendly about it; they just wanted to know how I would fit into their firm culture. They reviewed my portfolio and working drawings and seemed very interested in continuing to learn about me.\n\nEverything went fine until they asked me if I was finished with school. I told them that I was graduating with my undergraduate degree and was planning on going back in a few years to complete my masters degree. It was as if a balloon popped! The conversation went downhill from there. They felt as much as they were impressed with the interview they were looking for someone long-term. They said they would call me with an answer but never got around to ever emailing me again.",
                "Lessons Learned": "I still wonder to this day if I should have stated that I wasn’t considering going back to school. I may have gotten the position that way. The truth is sometimes you don’t really know if you are going to go back. I feel like you should treat situations like this as a business. It isn’t lying to say you aren’t going back to school. A situation may come up where you don’t want to go back! Regardless, you should treat interviews as a business and stretch or withhold information in order to get the most of a business opportunity, your interview.",

                "Background Story": "Prior to interviewing for this job, I had just been laid off from a job that I really liked and I thought I was doing very well at. Despite the strong economic climate and being very busy at this job, I was laid off in January of 2016, just two weeks into the new year. Having survived the Great Recession of 2008-2012, I had already interviewed at most firms in the Dallas area and knew where I did and did not want to be. Indeed, I had interviewed at this firm twice previously and had not been hired due to the economic climate, but knew that I liked the work they did and their office atmosphere seemed warm and inviting. My godfather knows the current CEO very well (college buddies) so he gave him a call and set up an interview for me. (Note, this was not necessary and I could have easily called and gotten a time myself, but this connection did not hurt). I interviewed in late January of 2016. ",
                "Experience During Interview": "My interview lasted approximately 90 minutes and was attended by both the CEO and the COO of the firm. I cannot recall specific questions asked, however, the focus was on whether or not I had technical knowledge of buildings and if I could use Revit or not. Attire at this firm is business professional and both of my interviewers wore a suit and tie. I also wore a black suit and high heels. ",
                "Lessons Learned": "Prior to this interview, I looked at the company's website to gain a bit more knowledge of their projects and where they had been and wanted to go as a firm. This technique will always benefit a person who is looking into whether or not they might have an interest in a firm. While I was not in love with their design style, they had recently won some large notable projects and from that, I learned that my job might be a little more secure. I was able to ask and talk about these projects and what my personal interests were because I did this. Always ask what the firm is looking for in an employee and do not be afraid to ask this question. Are they interested in you and your talents or are you just a body filling a seat? I did not ask this question and just assumed they had a place for me based on my talents. Therefore, I struggled at this firm initially. \n\nAfter the interview, I made sure to follow up with emails to my interviewers thanking them for their time. In these emails I did provide a link to my graduate portfolio and a few other links for projects I had worked on in the past. ",
                "Documents Brought": "I brought a current resume as well as a set of drawings I worked on at the firm I was laid off from. Be very careful in doing this as drawings are technically the property of the firm you work for. I found the drawings to be more valuable than a portfolio since I had so much practical experience already. ",

                "Background Story": "This was my first interview in the Dallas area. After graduation, my (now) wife had recently moved from south Louisiana and I was attempting to find a job closeby to avoid uprooting her again. \n\nI searched for jobs and had interviews in Jackson (MS) , Shreveport, and Monroe. While I received responses and interviews, before the interviews would even start, I would be told they weren't hiring at the moment, but would keep me in touch if anything changed. \n\nThe firm in Jackson had me come in twice for interviews, and then kept me on hold for two months to respond that they decided they wouldn't be hiring me. \n\nAt this point, I had a few fellow graduates that got jobs quickly in the Dallas area and we decided to try here, and that led to a very quick hire and start date. ",
                "Experience During Interview": "Short interview, less than 30 minutes. I was asked about my summer internship, experience at that office and work I did. I was asked a few questions about my portfolio, but not much. Generally, the conversation seemed to be more about my personality as a fit for the office than my design capability or experience. ",
                "Lessons Learned": "This may not be applicable to larger firms or all firms, but for this interview and most interviews prior, it seems to go a long way to be relaxed and express the things you enjoy and be enthusiastic about them. In most of the interviews I had that led to the one that got me the job, and the final interview, it seemed to be about if I would be a good fit with the others in the office rather than my ability and previous design experience. \n\nThis is likely because I was coming straight from grad-school however, and if I were to have more experience I'm sure the conversation would have been more about my qualifications. This was my first architecture firm employment.",
                "Documents Brought": "Resume, portfolio, drawings from previous Summer internship. Seemed that the drawings were helpful moreso than portfolio. Employer commented on lineweights and readability being good and that I wouldnt have to be trained much in Autocad.",

                "Lessons Learned": "Architecture is not what you are being taught in school. For the most part. The depth of the profession is so much more than what most professors will take the time to teach.

At this time, I submitted a portfolio and resume to him. I was going to be in town for 1 week and told them the days I could come in for the interview. From my availability, we set a date.",
                "Experience During Interview": "Being that I had previously worked there he said he knew from experience that I was more than capable for the position. He didn’t ask me too many questions but rather spoke about changes in the work environment. When he opened the floor to me, I asked several questions about what I valued in the work setting.\n\nThe interviewer was ready to wrap things up and stated that they would email me an offer within a week. I was surprised that the salary negotiation was completely skipped over! I told him I wanted to talk about salary negotiations and I asked for a number much higher than he anticipated. A week later, I received an offer matching what I wanted. I felt the interview went really well!",
                "Lessons Learned": "If you have already worked for an employer hopefully you showed them the first time how you could be an asset to the team! Even if full-time employment isn’t specifically seen as an option at the moment, eventually they will be hiring full time, and when they do, you want them to want you back. Knowing this I think you have more leverage having worked there before and can negotiate a better salary.\n\nSometimes interviewers may say that they want you and skip over the salary conversation entirely. I think this is a clever trick on their part. If you accept their offer without knowing the pay, you will get the lowest salary that they were going to offer. If the employer says that they can make an offer, be sure and bring up salary if they do not!",

                "Background Story": "I met with the firm at a Career Fair a year into my Graduate School program. We talked about the working environment of the office and how to cope with being a part of a bigger firm. The employee I talked to was really helpful and she opened my eyes to the opportunity to trying to get a job in a \"corporate\" firm. I told her I still had another year in grad school so she said when I started looking to contact the company with my resume and portfolio. As of March 2016, two months until graduation, I made contact with my connection within the firm and submitted my application. I was contacted a week later asking for a skype meeting to talk to two studio heads.",
                "Experience During Interview": "I had two types of interviews with this company. The first was the skype, which was a \"get to know me\" interview where they asked typical questions like what do I like to do in my free time, and the ever dreaded \"tell us about yourself\" question. They want to know if your personality will fit into their firm. With it being in the moment, my answer didn't sound rehearsed or practiced which is the kind of response they want to hear. \n\nShortly after ending the skype call, I got an email saying they wanted to fly me to Dallas for a second interview. Obviously, this means they're serious about hiring so I agreed to meet and tour the office. It was very helpful to be in the actual work place and see how they worked within the office. Each studio head took me to their studio area and showed me some work in progress. It felt more like they were trying to impress me at the same time I wanted to impress them with my work. I think being in the actual office made it seem more real and helped me make a decision in the end.",
                "Lessons Learned": "I've read dozens of interview tips online that go over these standard questions and how you should answer them. In the end, researching the \"typical\" safe answer that didn't help me much in the long run. When the moment came, I gave myself a few seconds to think about the question and what they were really asking. You don't want to sound like a robot so answer as naturally and truthfully as you can. There were also some questions they asked that didn't have a right answer but it was to see what my answer would be. Those types of questions you can't prepare for so just answer as truthfully as possible and let your personality come through.\n\nI've had about an even number with interviewing via Skype and in-person interviews at the office. It is nice to go to the actual office where you would be working to get a feel for the environment. It's important that you feel comfortable with that specific workplace. So, if you have the option to visit that actual office, it would be more beneficial to you, and would show you're really interested.",

                "Background Story": "At my current job, a previous employee was telling me about his new firm was looking to expand its Architecture Department; they were primarily an Engineering Firm. I was working for my current firm for a year, opportunity for growth was limited and current environment was becoming hostile and unwelcoming. ",
                "Experience During Interview": "It was about an hour long, I was meeting with the Office Director and the Architect in charge at that branch. I discovered that the company was across the country with 12 separate offices; similar to my current job that had once office in Arkansas and the other in Los Angeles but bigger. They seemed to want to discuss my skill set instead of testing it with a CAD File. With my knowledge of CAD lingo, getting to know SketchUp and Photoshop they seemed to get the idea that I was able to do the job. Asked about previous job experience, told them current situation and why I wanting to leave. \n\nThey gave me a tour of their current SMALL office, only about 12 people in that branch at the moment and only 2 were in architecture (my friend and his boss the Architect). They said I should be hearing form their corporate HR sooner with an offer for me to review. ",
                "Lessons Learned": "The handling of leaving my current job I took delicately. My current project manager butted heads with me and would get a tone and even short fuse of a temper as well. So, I went to our HR coordinator and asked if I could have her come with me when I tell my boss I'm quitting. She completely understood, surprised that I had the balls to quit but completely understood why. I sat down with him and she joined us, he knew something was up, told him flat out that I appreciate everything I learned but, that my current job is just not the right fit. I gave it a year to make sure and I knew then and there that I needed to move on. He was calm and understanding and he tried to counter offer, I told him it wasn't about money but more on the atmosphere. He understood and then we worked on the paper work for my exit. \n\nWith my new job that I interviewed with, I knew I was going to working in a more \"macho\" male environment, so I had to dress the part per-say. Alas why I felt uncomfortable not being in jeans. After a week of being at my new job, the office had a keg and beer Fridays, got my work done and went to get myself a cold one. During this week not a lot of the guys talked to me, only the architect and my friend; the rest were engineers and good ole boys. I walk to the table where everyone else is sitting and one of them made the smart remark \"You know, I figured you were one of the guys that liked those fruity drinks with an umbrella in them.\" They laughed and so did I with the response \"No, unlike you I went to architecture school and they taught us at least two good things.\" I took my full glass of beer and chug it down in one gulp and slam the empty glass on to the table. \"We learned architecture and how to drink. Now, how about a refill sweetheart.\" All of them BUSTED OUT LAUGHING.  After that they finally started talking to me and got to know me for me. \n\nSometimes you need to know the crowd you're working with, (this can also apply to clients too) but above all else, be yourself and don't compromise.

                "Background Story": "I started my career by picking the brains of my professors. I asked a simple question which turned into an email that was forwarded to a local architect that ultimately hired me. \n\nIt's funny how things work out but the architecture profession is small and everybody knows somebody who knows somebody. We are all connected in one way or another and I've found that using my network's network has been most beneficial to my career. \n\nI've landed at some great firms - sometimes without even sitting down for an interview - by simply asking a friend or professor to ask their friend at another firm a question. ",
                "Experience During Interview": "I've only had a few interviews but I aim to make them as laid back and easy going as possible. I sit back, cross my legs, cross my arms, lean back and forth... I am comfortable. I typically try to steer the conversation from the common \"what are your strengths\" questions to \"where did you vacation last year?\". I've cracked jokes, gotten to learn of people's children, wives and experiences out of the office. I try to connect on a personal level, while emphasizing my desire to work hard and learn what I know I need to learn or work on what I know or am told I need to work on. \n\nUltimately I want to work with people I like and can relate to and I'd like the same for the firm I end up joining so I like to make the interviews personal.  ",
                "Lessons Learned": "I made this mistake once so make sure you make an informed decision and don't make your life any harder than it already is. \n\nIf you are comfortable in your current work place and you receive a larger offer somewhere else, let your current firm know that you enjoy working there but you've been presented with other opportunities and you're considering exploring them. Make sure you have a legitimate conversation with both employers about why they want you, why you would make a good fit and what you can gain from either joining or staying. Don't rush it. Ultimately one firm will show that they truly value you. and DONT make it about the money. Yes the money helps, but that shouldn't be the deciding factor. \n\nIf you hate your job then just leave. If you hate getting up in the morning to go to work then you need to find a place that will allow you to enjoy going into work every day. In that case you simply submit your resignation two weeks prior to your departure and that is it. Tell someone in person first, explain to them why you are leaving and then send an email or write a letter to management. ",
                "Documents Brought": "I've brought portfolio's and drawing sets but I've found that to be mostly useless. You're asked to submit a digital portfolio when submitting your resume so they've already seen your work and most times they just flip through it in a matter of seconds. Unless your portfolio is special in some way ie. hand-made then I really don't see the point in bringing it. Of course, if they ask you should still bring it but even then I would try to be different. \n\nIn my case, I built an ever expanding portfolio by hand. I pressed my logo onto the cover manually. I cut, sanded and modified the hinges myself. I cut every single page to very specific dimensions. I scored every single page individually since they all had a slightly different score.. My portfolio was 100% unique and custom built so I wanted to show it off and show it off I did. Interestingly, most people comment on the quality of the portfolio as an object vs the quality of the work it shows, which is exactly what I was shooting for. ",

Since I had previously met him in a mutual leadership group I made sure to remind him of that involvement and tried to inquire candidly about the job positing in the company website. I also asked one of my professors who liked my work, to please put in a good word in for me with this person. I also personallised my portfolio toward this firm, my resume and cover letter where firm specific. Doing all of this and of course applying online for the job lets the employers know you are really interested in the position. I think all of this actions landed me the job at this firm.",
                "Experience During Interview": "I came dressed in a nice suit. I was first interviewed/briefed for like 15 minutes by the person I had contact within the firm. He then brought in two other head people from management department. I proceeded to answer a few questions to all three of them. \n\nThe questions I remember being asked are;\nTell us about your self, what kind of experience do you have? What are you looking for in a firm? and at the end, they asked me about the salary...\n\nI highly recommend doing good research about a firm, ask a one or two sincere questions about them, interact naturally and do not be afraid to show your personal side. I believe firms not only look for competent people but also relatable, bearable and friendly people... at the end of the day, they want someone who is a good fit for the team/firm. Show your hobbies, interests, etc... I enjoy doing that in every interview and I have found this is something that not only eases the environment but also shows your real self to the people hiring you.\n\nThe take away I had was that being conversational with the interviewers and casual instead of professional and stringent helped me better answer the questions and also sound more relaxed.",
                "Lessons Learned": "I think I prepared well for this interview because of the fact that I went a few extra steps in just trying to get the interview, so i highly recommend networking with professionals when the opportunity is there and getting involved in the porfessions because those connections matter a lot in the process. I went from grad school right into full time employment because I had a set goal for myself to start working in a firm full time immidiately after graduating from college. Setting goals for myself has greatly helped me to stay focused and always growing as a professional. \nI highly recommend students to jump into something earlier rather than later... computer programs - look up a youtube video and start using it\ndesign projects - think of a conceptual project and design it\nleadership - get involved in a professional organization or find a mentor and get advice. The two people I have asked gladly said yes to my request.\nprofessional experience in a firm - ask the firm you would like to work in, for the things they look for in a prospect employee and go to work on those, next time you contact that firm, you'll have mastered exactly what they told you...\nI have found that surrounding myself with ambitious and growth oriented people has been encouraging and inspiring since I also want to continue to grow and have great goals and great ambitions...",

                "Background Story": "I was currently working at a firm that I had invested almost 3 years into, moved to Dallas for and promises of advancement were not fulfilled. Additionally, the clients that I worked relationship on for the last two years were being pushed aside, and upper management at the firm were more business oriented than client relations focused. I kept getting the same ole CAD monkey work and needed more of a challenge that I once had with the clients I enjoyed working with. Basically, I was no longer happy with the firm I was working with and realized if they were not going to give me the opportunities, then I needed to find it else where.   \n\nI casually started looking around and my partner at the time had an architect friend, and reached out to him on some guidance on any opportunities with his or other firms. Luckily, said friend's firm was looking to hire which led up to meeting with him and then eventually, the other partners for the firm. Two interviews which is common. ",
                "Experience During Interview": "I had two interviews. \n\nThe first one was about an hour with the contact I had through my partner. That made the interview a little more friendly and relaxed. Still a little nervous but in the back of my mind, this was the first interview since my last job, needed the experience in the interview process again so, I had nothing to loose; I had a job already. \n\nWe talked through my portfolios, discussed construction types I was use to and with that showed skill sets in CAD, Renderings, Photoshop and end results. Its good to show that you've taken a project from beginning to end in my mind. We then discussed their work, studio dynamics, what would be my role and what would I be starting off with if and when I joined. Toured the studios, it was late in the evening since I had to do it after work so, a handful of people which showed me that they were there all the time passed 6:00PM. We wrapped up and he told me he would be getting with the partners of the firm.\n\n[TWO WEEKS LATER]\n\nI hadn't heard from my contact, reached out to him and discovered he was on a business trip and was trapped there during a severe winter storm. He would be returning and be able to get with the partners that week. \n\nThe second interview was with two other partners at the firm; my contact was unavailable to attend and also, no bias. We walked through the same previously mentioned topics as in the first, this time around I was even more relaxed and even my clothing selection was a little more young hip professional (Button-up shirt with a slimming coat vest and in jeans). The main difference was we got down to my actual role and since I had previous experience, i wouldn't be starting at the bottom but since I had never done residential construction, I wasn't going to immediately get the level I should with the experience I had. Also, this is when they asked for my \"Magic Number\" for salary. This was the first time in 4 years of experience that I was asked what I wanted and/or needed for Salary. I always had my magic number in my head, again, I had a job so I had nothing to loose and they could counter offer. I gave them my number, they wrote it down and we moved on with another tour of the office. \n\nBy the end of that week, I had an offer in my Inbox with the magic number. I waited the weekend to confirm my acceptance and that Monday I also gave my two weeks notice. ",
                "Lessons Learned": "This was again an interview were I didn't have anything to loose, only gain. I think if you go in that mind set, that there is only positive outcomes whether that be experience with the interview process and getting to know other firms in your area, that will help you build on your presentation of yourself and your work. Be professional, show that you can get the job done and take responsibility for your work and own it. This can be shown in previous jobs or even with your school work. Architecture is not all about pretty renderings, its also showing you can think and bring something to the table. Focus on your passions, your skills and what you can bring to the firm. \n\nAlso, dress for the job you want, I wanted to have a young and fresh professional job, I didn't want a stuffy three piece suit where I had to wear a tie every day. Keep in mind, McDonald's at least has a uniform so think twice about showing up in jeans and a graphic tee. \n\nLastly, if you have a current job, for some it can be a difficult step to take the leap of faith and give your two weeks notice. I've quit jobs before, wasn't my first one but I would always say to talk to your boss in person or on the phone to let them know. Don't send an email, you want to leave your current employer on good terms; never know when you might want to come back. My boss tried to counter offer and ask how much I was being offered and anything he could do to keep him there. You DO NOT have to indulge that information; to which I did not. I told him I wanted to try a new field of construction and the opportunity for my growth at my current job was no longer there. He understood and also admitted he knew this was coming due to the fact that he wasn't able to keep his previous promises. \n\nTwo weeks later I started at my current job. ",

                "Documents Brought": "I made TWO separate portfolios and brought a few copies of my resume; wasn't sure how many would be attending. One showing my Thesis and the other was my new Professional Career Portfolio. \n\nAt the time I was also working on some Augmented Reality programming and brought my iPAD to show the new tech. They were impressed with how easy it was and that I, on my own without office support, was able to do this. I had to make sure that it worked and spent probably two days on it making tweaks here and there.\n\nHaving both hard copy and a digital interactive helped show my skills and responsibility in that I had back-up just in case \"life happens\" moment.

                "Experience During Interview": "I arrived early and was given a tour of the office before the interview. We conducted the interview in a conference room with the aforementioned connection and a lead designer. The interview initially consisted of me going through my portfolio and explaining the design process of each project. We then transitioned to a series of questions pertaining to my previous experience at other firms and at school, my interests both related and unrelated to architecture, the reasoning for wanting to move to the DFW area, and what I was looking for in my career. I made sure to also ask them questions about what sort of projects the office worked on and where they saw the office would be five and twenty years from then. They expressed that they were looking for someone that can take the initiative and be productive without directions, and seemed to be most concerned with hiring people that were compatible with the office culture. The attire in the office was business casual with the occasional dress jacket and tie. For the interview I wore a nice sport coat and dress slacks.",
                "Lessons Learned": "I was worried about being too visibly nervous in the process and it turned out fine. It's okay to be nervous, that really shouldn't be a motivating factor for or against you at an office that you would want to work at. Remember to prepare thoughtful questions that you can ask the firm that not only will help you determine if it is the right place for you, but that will also show your potential employer that you are being considerate and have the ability to make good choices.",

                "Background Story": "So I moved to San Antonio, TX in August of 2015.  This WAS NOT because of a job offer, it was just a quick decision I had made for my life since I knew Texas has a lot to offer in the architectural field.  I needed quick money, so I got a job at Blackmon Mooring as a water mitigation technician (basically we would demolish and dry out any residential or commercial structures affected by water intrusion).   At this point I was still slowly putting my portfolio together when I had free time, and I was very close to hitting the one year anniversary of graduating with my Bachelor’s of Science in Architecture (pathetic, right? Keep reading on for some great advice).  So I FINALLY finished my portfolio and applied at a number of firms.  The first three firms that I interviewed with were in Houston.  The last interview was here in San Antonio, where I ended up getting hired.\n\n-----------------------\n\nNow here is something interesting.  My girlfriend’s aunt is an architect that got me the first three interviews in Houston.  In all of those interviews, I was told that they either were not hiring at the moment or they were just waiting for the right person to come along.  The interview that I got on my own in San Antonio was with the firm that was most interested in my work and personal skills, and it is the firm that I am now working at.  So at this time, I would like to rule out anyone’s opinion that says that “connections in the field” significantly matter and that it is the easiest or only way to get a job in the architectural field.  WRONG.  The amount of time and work and effort and passion that you put into your projects and portfolio is what is important when trying to get a job, and I promise you, from my own experience, THAT is what matters to a successful firm.  Just go out there and have confidence that you can bring something amazing to the firm’s table.",
                "Experience During Interview": "There was one positive thing about interviewing at three firms before my last one where I got hired.  Repetition, repetition, repetition.  Going through the interview process three times in just two days, I was able to get a good feel for the interview process, and this helped me to become comfortable when it came to my last interview.  I walked into the office and was seated in a conference room.  The architect who had contacted me came in and we shook hands and sat down.  Time for the interview, right? Wrong.  Three more architects walk in as I introduce myself to each of them.  They pulled up my digital portfolio on a T.V. screen, handed me the mouse and keyboard, and said, “It’s all yours.”\n\nNow that was intimidating… in a room with four architects that clearly have years and years of experience in the architectural field and I’m about to present my first portfolio page of a collage that I made out of magazine cut-outs…But I stopped, took a deep breath, and just thought about my other interviews.  I told myself, “I’ve done this three times already.  It’s time to prove what I’m worth.”  And from there on a wave of confidence came over me and any doubt that they had towards something, I came back and reassured them. \n\nSome questions that I encountered:\n\n- Was all of this work done by you or in a group? It seems like a simple question, but when I replied that almost all of my portfolio projects were done by myself, that’s when they began to show interest in hiring me.  personal work > group work unless you can very strongly back up the work load you were in charge of handling.\n\n- How much are you expecting to get paid if you are hired? I was asked this in all of my interviews, and I decided to go on a slightly different route than just saying a number. I just said that money was just a bonus, I was mainly looking for a great experience to further my education and firm experience so I can work towards becoming licensed. I just need enough money to survive.  They were pretty impressed with this answer and actually offered a great starting pay.\n\n-  What was your favorite part in developing your projects? They had mentioned before that if I did get a job at the firm, I would mainly start out doing detail work for their buildings, so I used that to my potential.  My reply was that I enjoyed taking an idea or goal and using that inspiration to reflect that in the gestural design phase of the project and how it was exciting to see how that gesture translated to a final product.  And then I mentioned at the end that I also enjoyed detailing buildings in section because I am very particular when it comes to how my building design pieces together.  The key to answering a question the way that the interviewers want to hear it is by listening to what they expect from you as an employee.",
                "Lessons Learned": "There are many things that can be learned from the interview process that I went through, not only for future interviews for myself but also anyone that is looking for a job in a firm.  The most important thing is having confidence in yourself and your work.  You didn’t go to school for multiple gruesome years to not learn anything.  Reflect back on your first year of design classes and then look at where you are today.  You would not have arrived at the knowledge capacity that you have today if it wasn’t for slowly (but surely) fighting through your design classes to better understand the field you are going into.  You know more than you think, and in order to have confidence, you have to realize that off the bat.  Yes, say what needs to be said to get through an interview, but don’t be afraid to let your work do some of the talking.  The next most important thing to learn from my experience is that repetition is the key to comfort.  Try and get as many interviews as you can, even if you aren’t really interested in what the firm has to offer.  The experience you gain from multiple interviews at architectural firms will give you a sense of the interview process, and you’ll go into the next interview with that much more confidence, knowledge, and comfort.",

What I mean by that is this - I had no connections in the industry in Dallas/Plano - I made lists of firms I was interested in and then I emailed and called them all relentlessly.  These emails and calls eventually led me to the right people within the firm and I was able to get a summer internship interview set up. That internship basically guaranteed me my interview the next year for a full time position.",
                "Experience During Interview": "During my internship interview I was extremely nervous. I was interviewed by three gentlemen of various experience levels. We had conversations about my work, my portfolio and resume, my passions and interests, my future dreams, and about the firm itself. About half way through the interview I finally calmed myself and realized that it was just a normal conversation and there was no reason to be nervous. They asked various questions: what was my favorite studio project, how did I like working in teams, what were some of my hobbies, what did I hope to gain out of an internship, what software and programs did I work in, where did I see my career in 5 years. ",
                "Lessons Learned": "Don't be nervous - it's just conversations. Practice interviewing with studio mates if necessary. Be honest in your answers and let your personality show through your interview. Share your passions and interests - sell yourself!",

Once I had my foot in the door sometimes that would lead to further conversation and I would try to express my interest in the firm and possibly get an interview set up.

And finally just be honest, tell them who you truly are and give them a sense of yourself as a both a person and a designer. Be confident and they will see you as a person and not just another potential employee.",

Establishing a personal connection either via phone call or thank you note can really reinforce the interview as well.

During January, I dedicated time to researching companies and firms that would hire students for the Summer. My program director, Tom Sammons, advised me to submit materials to the firm, as he has been trying to get some of our students in that firm. I formated my application and portfolio as per their requirements and sent it all a few days before their deadline.",
                "Experience During Interview": "The interview started at a very professional and serious tone. They clarified that they were interviewing almost 20 candidates and only hiring about 5. I believe they did this for me to get a grasp of the importance of the interview and to bring my A game. I did my best to speak about me OUTSIDE of the realm of architecture every chance I got. I got a sense that they hear the words \"urbanism\", \"mixed use\", \"program\" and \" juxtaposition\" way too often. They seemed very interested in my personal hobbies, likes and lifestyle. Of course, all these were eventually tied up to my ability to perform as a good architectural mind in their team. They asked me what my passions were within architecture and outside of the field, as well as what I would love to build a career on. ",
                "Lessons Learned": "Do not practice your interview. I think it is ok to think about the kinds of questions that are usually asked in an interview and prepare.

I was not getting to many responses probably due to fact that they receive a lot of applications.     Then I decided to just get on google maps and zoom in to cities that I'm interested in and look for architecture firms and their work.   Well I stumbled onto a small firm that was doing great work but had not really been around to long(3-4 years). And they had a job posting on their website that was not on the mass job posting spots.",
                "Experience During Interview": "The interview lasted around 45 minutes.  I was interviewed by both of the partners and they went back and forth asking me questions geared towards getting a feel for my design process and work process. They also asked a little about personality traits with the intent of figuring out if I would mess well with the team they had already in place. They prioritized a  cohesive studio over just finding people to produce work",

It was somewhat intimidating at first but things lightened up pretty quickly. Once I realized they weren’t necessarily focused on my work as much as my personality I started to relax. Their questions were pretty straight forward... “tell us about yourself” “what are your hobbies?” “ “what motivates you?” “What led you to our firm” “Why so far from home?” Etc... which I was more than prepared to answer. I also sprinkled bits of my personality in the form of light hearted jokes, sarcasm, and things of that sort in there and they responded very well to that. It’s very important to give your interviewers a sense of who you are during the interview so that you are memorable. ",
                "Lessons Learned": "Go into any interview prepared to answer the tough questions regarding your back ground, worth, etc. but keep in mind that it is YOUR interview and make sure to take advantage of your time.

There are lots of ways to set yourself apart but people always respond well to positivity. Always go into an interview with a positive attitude. ",

During the actual interview we hardly spoke of the materials I brought because they had already reviewed them prior to the interview.

                "Lessons Learned": "I maintained confidence in how I spoke about my work and my knowledge of the programs VectorWorks and Revit. Older Principals in a firm are often impressed with the knowledge our generation holds in terms of software. Also coming off friendly, personable, and fun helps especially in New Orleans where there is a laid back atmosphere and coworkers often go out for drinks to socialize. They want to hire someone they believe will get along with others and be pleasant to work with. \n\nWhen it came to quitting the job I already had, I gave them a 1 month notice and just let them know I didn't see myself staying in Lafayette and at my age (late 20's) I didn't want to have any regrets about exploring other cities.",

                "Experience During Interview": "Over the 4 month period I was invited to two interviews with the firm. The first interview was with a Project Architect that I would be working directly with. The meeting was an hour long and we reviewed my prior experience and a small amount of time with my portfolio. The second interview was with the Project Architect and one of the Principal Architects of the firm that led the team I was going to be assigned to. Here we discussed more of the job specific details such as salary and job requirements/responsibilities. Shortly after the second interview I was contacted with an official offer and start date which I accepted.\n\nIn the interviews I was asked to describe myself, my interests and what I enjoyed most about architecture. I found that regardless of what emphasis school placed on design that they seemed to be more interested in the practical application of architectural practice that I could bring to the firm. Construction Documents and knowledge of construction methods held more weight in the interviewing process than the pseudo theories of architecture I could \"relate to\". The principal of the firm that I eventually would be working for was a Harvard Graduate as well as a former professor at Texas Tech University. He was interested in what I knew and how it was that I designed, but more importantly he was interested in what I could bring to his team.",
                "Lessons Learned": "I actually went into the interview overly focused on my portfolio and what good/bad it would do for me. After both interviews I was extremely surprised when my portfolio was the least talked about item but who I was concerned them far more. This being my first official job following my college career opened my eyes to a new world of what architecture could be. Don't focus too much on one aspect of your presentation and remember that you are being critiqued just as much as any project items you place on the table for the people to review. Be yourself and be concise with what you want to say. A fake person is easy to point out but the habit of being you is easy to do while allowing you to focus on the questions that are being asked.",

The Resume spoke much more than my educational portfolio. I had some professional projects that I was able to throw in from the firm I had been working for so my knowledge of Construction Documents paid off far more than anything I had designed in school.",

For example your background and experience, your role on specific projects from your employment submission, which programs you know well, etc. In hindsight, the interview was a formality, I believe the recommendation from the current employees and my submission had gotten me the job prior to the interview. ",
                "Lessons Learned": "Networking is the biggest thing you don't learn in architecture school. Knowing someone, personally or professionally, at a firm is the best way to get your foot in the door. Both of my jobs post school were attained by knowing someone with a relationship with each firm. A firm will look into someone who is recommended by an employee, current or former, because they trust their judgement to know what the firm is looking for in a potential employee. \n\nAfter accepting the offer I gave my current firm a 4 weeks notice of my resignation. Luckily the firm that made the offer granted my request to have more time to do so along with extra time to move and set myself up in the new city/state.",

Not every firm will print your stuff out for the interview, I've learned this the hard way, so I find its good practice to have your own copy of it in case they want to discuss anything you submitted.",

                "Background Story": "This interview came from a series of events starting from a competition submission. A professor sent our class an email about a competition in Dallas, TX. I submitted a 1-page paper and presentation board and heard back within a month that I was chosen to present my paper and board in Dallas. Along with the competition, we would tour several firms in downtown Dallas. I sent portfolios and resumes to all of the firms I had gotten an \"in\" with. There was one person, in particular, I befriended during the tours whom I told I really wanted to come back to Dallas that upcoming summer. It turned out that the firm he worked for had an open position for a summer internship and invited me to come into Dallas for an interview. I told them I could not fly in, as I did not have the funds at the moment. To my surprise, they said a phone interview would be fine.",
                "Experience During Interview": "As I said before this interview was strictly over phone. The phone interview took about 30 minutes total. The interviewer and I went through my portfolio and resume page by page. The interviewer spent several minutes explaining what it was the firm was all about, and then asked several questions about me. I remember them asking,\n\n\"What project types are you most interested in working in?\" Thankfully they mentioned some of the project types they specialized in and I tailored my response to the project types they had available at the time.\n\n\"What do you think is fair pay for this internship?\" Earlier in our conversation, he mentioned the pay range for this position $16-$18 per hour. I really think the pay range came out by accident or was non-negotiable or something. I asked for $18 per hour since I knew it was within reach, then told them about my dedication and work ethic.\n\nThe interviewer told me that if selected, he would get back in touch with me via email within 3 weeks. I didn't hear back for 5 weeks when I learned I was selected for the position.",
                "Lessons Learned": "Don't under-estimate small opportunities! This experience started from a simple competition which took only about 8 hours of my time to complete.",

A professor sent our class an email stating that an alumni from our school whom was working in Dallas was reaching out to us for a position which was opening up at his firm. I introduced myself as a student of the professor and started an email conversation. I stated I was interested but could not work until summer, 6 months from then. He said to just keep in touch over the next coming months and a position may open.\n\nAs we continued to correspond a position opened up and he asked me if he could review my portfolio and resume to help tailor it to the principles of the firm. With his help I wrote a great cover letter to the firm and I emailed my package to the hiring principle. I also asked for advice on what to expect from the interview and he told me what the appropriate attire was and what to expect during the interview.",
                "Experience During Interview": "The interviewer immediately wanted to know what I had and we reviewed my 32 page portfolio from cover to cover. He said he was impressed with my portfolio but hoped to have seen more hand drawings and mixed media. I was taken on a tour of the firm and then went to lunch with 3 other high up people within the firm for another informal interview. After lunch we went back to the firm and in closing the interview I asked if they could make an offer based on our interview. They weren’t going to bring up salary so I had to initiate the conversation. The interviewer said he was ready with a number and we negotiated on a number that I was satisfied with.",
                "Lessons Learned": "This interview came from a contact who reached out to our university for a completely different position. I recommend staying in touch with any contacts you can find and start building a relationship with them, so that when a position comes up in the future, you will have a great contact to help get you in for an interview!",

                "Background Story": "Emailed a principal and connected about love of project-type.  I had a very good portfolio, which grabbed their attention as they mentioned in the interview.",
                "Experience During Interview": "All 3 principals were part of it.  They really were gauging my affability and potential engagement with a firm like theirs.  Most of the questions they asked centered around points I made in my portfolio, whether that be projects or things I did on the side.  It was a Skype interview, but I wore a simple button-down and tie.",
                "Lessons Learned": "If I had realized or researched enough to see the degree of their involvement with the AIA, that would have been just another topic to talk about in terms of the firm itself and what kind of citizen-architect they are looking for.",

                "Lessons Learned": "I would have been relieved to know the interview would only be conducted by one person.
